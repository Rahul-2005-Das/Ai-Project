<p>
The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began long before modern computers were invented. The idea of creating intelligent machines has fascinated humans for centuries. Ancient myths and stories often described mechanical beings that could think and act like humans. However, the scientific journey of AI truly started in the 20th century with the development of computer science.
</p>

<p>
In 1950, British mathematician <b>Alan Turing</b> introduced the concept of machine intelligence through the famous <b>Turing Test</b>. He proposed that if a machine could communicate in a way that a human could not tell whether it was a machine or a person, then it could be considered intelligent. This idea laid the foundation for future AI research.
</p>

<p>
The term <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> was officially introduced in 1956 during the <b>Dartmouth Conference</b> by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon. This event is considered the birth of AI as a field of study. Early AI programs focused on solving mathematical problems and playing games like chess.
</p>

<p>
During the 1960s and 1970s, AI research expanded into areas such as natural language processing and robotics. However, due to limited computing power and high expectations, AI development slowed down during periods known as <b>AI Winters</b>, when funding and interest decreased.
</p>

<p>
In the 1990s and 2000s, AI made a strong comeback with the growth of the internet, big data, and powerful computers. Machine Learning and Neural Networks became popular, allowing systems to learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.
</p>

<p>
Today, AI is more advanced than ever. Technologies like Deep Learning, computer vision, and voice recognition are used in smartphones, healthcare, self-driving cars, and many other fields. The journey of AI shows how human curiosity and innovation have transformed a simple idea into one of the most powerful technologies in the modern world.
